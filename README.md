                                  T20 World Cup Analysis - Power BI & Python Project


Project Overview
  This project analyzes player performances in the T20 World Cup using Power BI for visualization and Python for data preprocessing. 
  The goal is to filter, merge, and analyze player roles to create an optimized Final Team Selection based on key performance metrics.

Work Done in Python (.ipynb file)

  Data Preprocessing:
    Cleaned the dataset (handled missing values, formatted data types).
    Filtered relevant columns for Power BI analysis.
    Exported the processed dataset as a CSV for use in Power BI.
    
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Used pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to analyze player stats.
    Generated statistical insights to help in team selection.
    
  Performance Metrics Calculation:
    Created custom metrics for player evaluation (e.g., strike rate, economy rate).
    Used Python scripts to rank players based on key stats before importing the data into Power BI.
